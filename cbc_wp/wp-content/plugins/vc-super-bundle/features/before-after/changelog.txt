Version 1.3 - March 21, 2018
============================

* Enhanced: The slider can load a lower-resolution image on lower screen sizes.
* Fixed: Scrollbar settings may not apply at all.
* Added backend indicators in Visual Composer backend for easier identification of an element's instance and configuration.

* Enhanced: Mobile detection.
* Fixed an issue introduced during modernization that caused returning functions of the slider not to work.
* Added a routine that should disable blurring in angled image transformations. This should mitigate unwanted blur in angled images, but is not a guaranteed fix.
